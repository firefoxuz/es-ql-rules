name: "Shell Context Menu Command Tampering"
description: |
  Detects registry modifications to Windows Shell context menu command handlers.
  Attackers may tamper with shell context menu entries to achieve persistence or
  stealthy execution by hijacking right-click actions.
  False positives: Likely during legitimate software installation or customization
  (e.g., PowerShell, Git, archive tools, developer utilities).
  Triage: Identify the modified shell key and command, validate the executing binary,
  check the modifying process and user context, and correlate with subsequent executions
  triggered via Explorer context menu actions.
