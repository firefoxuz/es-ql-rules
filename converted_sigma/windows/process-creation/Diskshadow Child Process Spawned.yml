name: "Diskshadow Child Process Spawned"
description: |
  Detects any child process spawned from Diskshadow.exe. Diskshadow can be used in interpreter/script mode
  and may leverage the "exec" capability to launch other applications (LOLBin-style execution).
  Attackers have used Diskshadow for VSS evasion, persistence, and to facilitate access to sensitive data
  (e.g., NTDS/AD database extraction workflows).
  False positives: Possible/likely if Diskshadow is legitimately used (especially interpreter mode).
  Triage: Identify the spawned child process, check if Diskshadow was executed with script/interpreter options,
  review the command line for "exec", and correlate with shadow copy deletion, NTDS access, and suspicious file writes.
