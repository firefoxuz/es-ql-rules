name: "New Self Extracting Package Created Via IExpress.EXE"
description: |
  Detects creation of self-extracting packages via IExpress. Attackers have been observed leveraging
  iexpress.exe to compile packages on the fly, often via .sed configuration files.
  This rule matches either:
   (1) makecab.exe spawned by iexpress.exe, or
   (2) iexpress.exe executed with the /n flag (non-interactive build).
  False positives: Administrators legitimately building packages using IExpress.
