name: "ClickOnce Deployment Execution - Dfsvc.EXE Child Process"
description: |
  Detects child processes spawned by dfsvc.exe (ClickOnce service) where the executed image path
  is within the typical ClickOnce cache directory under the user profile:
  \AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\ . This indicates ClickOnce deployment execution.
  False positives: Expected in environments that legitimately use ClickOnce. Baselining and
  allowlisting known publishers/apps is recommended before production use.
