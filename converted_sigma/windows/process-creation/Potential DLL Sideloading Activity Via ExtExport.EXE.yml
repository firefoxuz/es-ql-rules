name: "Potential DLL Sideloading Activity Via ExtExport.EXE"
description: |
  Detects execution of Extexport.exe (Internet Explorer utility). This LOLBin can be abused for DLL sideloading
  by loading specific DLL names (e.g., mozcrt19.dll, mozsqlite3.dll, sqlite.dll) from a supplied folder or via
  certain flag combinations.
  False positives: Unknown. Use as a hunting baseline and tune with allowlists if Extexport is legitimately used.
