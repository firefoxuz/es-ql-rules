name: "Dynamic .NET Compilation Via Csc.EXE - Hunting"
description: |
  Detects execution of csc.exe (C# compiler) with command line pattern "/noconfig /fullpaths @" which is
  commonly seen during dynamic/on-the-fly .NET compilation. Adversaries may compile payloads locally to
  evade detections and remove the need to drop precompiled binaries.
  False positives: Many legitimate applications use dynamic compilation. Use this rule to hunt for anomalies.
