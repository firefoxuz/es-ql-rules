name: "Curl.EXE Execution With Custom UserAgent"
description: |
  Detects curl.exe execution with custom User-Agent options (-A or --user-agent).
  Adversaries may set a custom User-Agent to blend in with legitimate traffic or to match
  expected C2 profiles. This is a hunting rule; developers/admins may legitimately use
  custom user agents in automation.
  False positives: Developer/admin scripts and legitimate automation.
