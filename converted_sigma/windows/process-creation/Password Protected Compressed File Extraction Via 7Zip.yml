name: "Password Protected Compressed File Extraction Via 7Zip"
description: |
  Detects usage of 7-Zip command-line utilities (7z.exe/7za.exe/7zr.exe) to extract password-protected archives.
  Adversaries often deliver or stage payloads inside encrypted archives to bypass content inspection and AV scanning.
  This is a hunting rule because legitimate password-protected extraction can be common in some environments.
  Triage: Review the archive source and destination (-o), check parent process (email client, browser, Office),
  validate where the extracted files landed (Temp/Downloads/AppData), and correlate with subsequent execution of
  dropped binaries/scripts.
