name: "Headless Process Launched Via Conhost.EXE"
description: |
  Detects child process execution where the parent process is conhost.exe and the parent
  command line includes the "--headless" flag. The --headless flag suppresses visible windows,
  allowing processes to run without user awareness. This behavior has been observed in
  fake browser update chains and unauthorized software execution.
  False positives: Unknown. Use as a hunting baseline and tune with allowlists if needed.
  Triage: Review the spawned child process, validate its binary path and signer, inspect
  the parent command line for installer/update lures, and correlate with persistence,
  network connections, or sustained CPU usage.
