name: "File Download Via Curl.EXE"
description: |
  Detects file download activity using curl.exe by identifying curl execution with output flags such as
  -O/--remote-name/--output. Attackers may use curl to download tools or payloads from remote servers.
  False positives: Developer/admin scripts and legitimate automation; Git for Windows may use curl with
  --output in temp (gfw-httpget-xxxxxxxx.txt). Use as a hunting baseline and tune with allowlists.
