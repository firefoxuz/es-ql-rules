name: "Potential File Override/Append Via SET Command"
description: |
  Detects cmd.exe usage of the internal SET command with the /p flag followed directly by "=" (set /p=),
  which can be abused to indirectly write/append content to files when combined with redirection (>>, >).
  Example: cmd /c >> example.txt set /p="test data" (appends "test data" to example.txt).
  While set /p= is normally used to prompt for user input, threat actors have used this pattern in ransomware
  campaigns to modify files stealthily.
  False positives: Legitimate scripts that use set /p for prompting or simple file writing. Treat as hunting
  baseline and tune by excluding known script paths and benign parent processes.
  Triage: Review the full command line to identify target file(s), look for >> or > operators, assess the
  parent process chain, and correlate with file modifications, persistence, or ransomware-like activity.
