name: "Potential Data Exfiltration Via Curl.EXE"
description: |
  Detects curl.exe execution with common upload/data submission flags that may indicate potential
  data exfiltration or outbound data transfer (e.g., --upload-file, --form, --data* or short flags
  -F/-T/-d). This is a hunting rule; developer/admin automation may legitimately upload data.
  Filters: excludes localhost targets.
  Triage: Inspect destination URL/domain, payload/file paths, parent process, user context, and
  correlate with recent data staging (Compress-Archive), credential access, or unusual network egress.
