name: "CMD Shell Output Redirect"
description: |
  Detects execution of cmd.exe with output redirection using the ">" operator.
  Adversaries may redirect the output of reconnaissance commands (e.g., hostname, whoami, dir)
  to files for later collection or exfiltration.
  False positives: Common in scripting and administration; use as a hunting baseline and
  tune by excluding known scripts and benign parent processes.
  Triage: Review the full command line to identify redirected output files, verify the parent
  process and user context, and correlate with subsequent file access, compression, or exfiltration.
