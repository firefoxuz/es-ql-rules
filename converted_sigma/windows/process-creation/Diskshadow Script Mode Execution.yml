name: "Diskshadow Script Mode Execution"
description: |
  Detects execution of Diskshadow.exe in script mode using the "/s" (or -s) flag.
  Adversaries often abuse Diskshadow with scripts to delete or manipulate shadow copies (VSS),
  aiding defense evasion and impacting recovery.
  False positives: Likely in environments with legitimate backup/maintenance scripts.
  Triage: Review the referenced script path, its location (Temp/AppData/Downloads vs admin paths),
  and correlate with shadow copy deletion behavior, backup failures, and follow-on ransomware activity.
