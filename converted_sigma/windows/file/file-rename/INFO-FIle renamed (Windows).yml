# 4) File Renamed (generic hunting / best-effort)
name: "INFO - File Renamed (Windows) - Hunting"
description: |
  Informational baseline for file rename activity. Many pipelines do not provide both old/new names in ECS.
  This rule hunts by looking for file events that mention rename/move in event.action/type/dataset.
  If you have explicit old/new path fields, replace the logic to use them.
