name: "Access To Windows Outlook Mail Files By Uncommon Applications"
description: |
  Detects file access requests to Windows Mail/Outlook app mailbox storage locations (Unistore/UnistoreDB)
  by uncommon processes. This can indicate mailbox data access for theft, manipulation, or wiping.
  Requires heavy baselining before production usage.
  Requirements: Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File ETW provider (or equivalent file access telemetry).
  False positives: AV/EDR, backup tools, search/indexing tools (e.g., Everything), legit software installed
  outside C:\, and some forensic/IR tooling.
