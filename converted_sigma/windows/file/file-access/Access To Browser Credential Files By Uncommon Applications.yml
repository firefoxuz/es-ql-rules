name: "Access To Browser Credential Files By Uncommon Applications"
description: |
  Detects file access requests to browser credential stores (IE WebCache, Firefox profile stores,
  Chromium Login Data/Local State) by uncommon processes. This can indicate credential stealing
  activity (infostealers). Requires heavy baselining before production use.
  Requirements: Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File ETW provider (or equivalent file access telemetry).
  False positives: AV/EDR, backup tools, search/indexing tools (e.g., Everything), legit software
  installed outside C:\, and some forensic/IR tooling.
