  \Panther\unattend.xml. This file can contain embedded credentials and is commonly targeted for
  credential discovery.
  Requirements: Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File ETW provider (or equivalent file access telemetry).
  False positives: Unknown. Use as a hunting baseline and validate the accessing process context.
