name: "Access To .Reg/.Hive Files By Uncommon Applications"
description: |
  Detects file access to files ending with ".reg" or ".hive", commonly associated with Windows Registry
  exports/backups. Uncommon processes accessing these files may indicate registry manipulation, persistence,
  or defense evasion activity.
  Requirements: Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File ETW provider (or equivalent file access telemetry).
  False positives: Third-party software running from user context may cause noise; heavy baselining/tuning is recommended.
