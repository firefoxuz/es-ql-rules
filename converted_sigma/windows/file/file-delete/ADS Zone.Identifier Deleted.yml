name: "ADS Zone.Identifier Deleted"
description: |
  Detects deletion of the Zone.Identifier alternate data stream (ADS) by matching file delete events
  where the target filename ends with ":Zone.Identifier". Removing this ADS can bypass Mark-of-the-Web
  (MOTW) based security restrictions used by Windows and Microsoft Office.
  False positives: Likely (some tools/cleanup actions remove ADS). Use as hunting baseline and tune.
