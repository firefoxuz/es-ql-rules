rule_id: 23023d5b-8e55-4e4b-b772-7c1437c68eb8
name: "WDAC Policy File Creation In CodeIntegrity Folder"
description: |
  Detects creation of WDAC policy-related files (.cip / .p7b) inside the privileged
  Windows Code Integrity directory (C:\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity\) by a high-integrity
  (elevated) process. Attackers can weaponize WDAC to block EDR drivers while allowing
  malicious code, requiring a reboot to take effect.
  Note: This rule expects IntegrityLevel telemetry; if you don't ingest it, treat this as
  a hunting rule based on the folder/file extension and then correlate with elevation/admin activity.
