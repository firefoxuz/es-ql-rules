name: "VsCode Code Tunnel Execution File Indicator"
description: |
  Detects creation of a file named "code_tunnel.json", an indicator of Visual Studio Code tunneling
  utility usage. This feature can be abused to establish an external access / C2-like channel.
  False positives: Legitimate VSCode tunnel usage will also trigger this.
