name: "PFX File Creation"
description: |
  Detects creation of PFX files (.pfx). PFX (Personal Information Exchange) bundles private keys and
  certificates, which can be targeted for certificate theft, impersonation, code signing abuse, or
  persistence via cert-based auth.
  Filters exclude common benign dev/automation locations and OneDrive CodeSigning.pfx.
  Requirements: file event telemetry where created/target file path is captured.
