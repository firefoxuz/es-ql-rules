name: "Data Exfiltration with Wget Detection"
description: |
  Detects attempts to post files using the wget utility.
  The adversary can bypass permission restrictions with misconfigured sudo permissions for wget,
  which could allow them to read sensitive files like /etc/shadow and exfiltrate them.
  The --post-file flag is used to send file contents via HTTP POST.
