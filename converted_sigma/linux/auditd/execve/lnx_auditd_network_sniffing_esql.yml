name: "Network Sniffing Detection - Linux"
description: |
  Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.
  An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.
  Detects usage of tcpdump and tshark network sniffing tools.
  Note: Legitimate administrators may use these tools for troubleshooting. Baseline your environment.
