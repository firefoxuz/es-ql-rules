name: "BPFDoor Port Redirection Detection"
description: |
  Detects BPFDoor malware port redirection technique using iptables.
  BPFDoor is a Linux backdoor that uses BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) to hide network traffic.
  The malware uses iptables to redirect traffic from one port to another for command and control.
  This is a specific indicator of compromise for BPFDoor activity.
