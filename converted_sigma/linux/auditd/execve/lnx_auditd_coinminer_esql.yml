name: "Possible Coin Miner CPU Priority Detection"
description: |
  Detects command line parameter very often used with coin miners.
  Cryptocurrency miners like XMRig use the --cpu-priority flag to control CPU usage and priority.
  This flag is commonly seen in cryptojacking and unauthorized mining activities.
  Note: Monitor for processes using this flag in conjunction with other mining indicators.
