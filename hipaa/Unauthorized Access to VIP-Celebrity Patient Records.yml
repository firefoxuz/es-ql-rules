description: |
  Identifies inappropriate access to medical records of VIP patients, celebrities,
  public figures, or high-profile individuals without legitimate treatment relationship
  or authorization. HIPAA §164.502(a) prohibits access without authorized purpose.
  Detects chart opens of flagged VIP patients by staff not assigned to their care,
  unusual access volumes to celebrity records, or access outside clinical departments.
  "Snooping" on famous patients is common HIPAA violation. Monitor VIP patient
  access patterns and correlate with care team assignments and clinical necessity.
