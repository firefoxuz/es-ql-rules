name: "RULE-HIPAA-12: PHI Disclosed to Unauthorized External Party"
description: |
  Identifies disclosure of Protected Health Information to external parties without
  patient authorization or HIPAA-permitted exception under §164.502(a). Detects
  emails containing PHI sent to non-healthcare domains, file transfers of medical
  records to unauthorized IPs, fax transmissions with patient data to unverified
  numbers, or API data exports to third parties without Business Associate Agreements.
  PHI disclosures require authorization except for treatment, payment, healthcare
  operations, or specific regulatory exceptions. Monitor outbound PHI flows and
  correlate with authorized disclosure registry.
