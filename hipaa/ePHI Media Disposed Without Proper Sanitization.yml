#//RULE-HIPAA-22 — Media Disposal Without Sanitization - §164.310(d)(2)(i)
#//Requirement: HIPAA Security Rule §164.310(d)(2)(i) - Disposal
#//Objective: Detect improper disposal of media containing ePHI
#//Data sources: Asset disposal logs, device retirement logs, sanitization logs
#//ECS fields used: event.action, event.original, event.original  # FIXME: asset.type not available, event.category
#//Healthcare field validation: Verify EHR/EMR fields exist in your indices (event.original  # FIXME: patient.id not available, encounter.id, etc.)
#//Tuning notes: Track asset lifecycle; verify wiping/destruction certificates

name: "ePHI Media Disposed Without Proper Sanitization"
description: |
  Identifies disposal or retirement of hardware and media containing ePHI without
  documented sanitization procedures as required by HIPAA §164.310(d)(2)(i). Detects
  hard drives, servers, workstations, backup tapes, or mobile devices decommissioned
  without wiping certificates, shredding documentation, or degaussing records.
  Improper media disposal can lead to ePHI breaches when discarded devices are
  accessed by unauthorized parties. Monitor asset disposal workflow and verify
  NIST 800-88 compliant sanitization for all retired media.
