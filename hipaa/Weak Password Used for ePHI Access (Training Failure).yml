#//RULE-HIPAA-27 — Password Security Training Gap - Weak Password Detected - §164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D)
#//Requirement: HIPAA Security Rule §164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D) - Password Management
#//Objective: Detect weak passwords indicating training failure
#//Data sources: Authentication logs, password policy violation logs
#//ECS fields used: event.action, user.name, event.outcome, log.original
#//Tuning notes: Monitor password change events; detect policy violations

name: "RULE-HIPAA-27: Weak Password Used for ePHI Access (Training Failure)"
description: |
  Identifies weak passwords used to access ePHI systems, indicating failure of
  password management training required by HIPAA §164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D). Detects
  password changes rejected due to insufficient complexity, accounts with passwords
  matching common patterns (Password1, Summer2024), or authentication with known
  weak credentials. Password management training must cover creating, changing,
  and safeguarding passwords. Weak passwords on healthcare systems increase
  unauthorized access risk. Monitor password strength and correlate with training
  effectiveness.
