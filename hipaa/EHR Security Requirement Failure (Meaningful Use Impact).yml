#//RULE-HIPAA-34 — EHR Meaningful Use Security Violation - HITECH Act
#//Requirement: HITECH Act - EHR Meaningful Use Security Requirements
#//Objective: Detect security violations impacting meaningful use attestation
#//Data sources: EHR audit logs, meaningful use reporting logs
#//ECS fields used: event.action, log.original, user.name
#//Tuning notes: Monitor meaningful use criteria; track security objectives compliance

name: "RULE-HIPAA-34: EHR Security Requirement Failure (Meaningful Use Impact)"
description: |
  Identifies failures in Electronic Health Record security requirements that impact
  Meaningful Use attestation and HITECH Act incentive program eligibility. Detects
  missing encryption on patient portals, audit log gaps in certified EHR systems,
  patient electronic access requests not fulfilled, or secure messaging failures.
  Meaningful Use requires protecting ePHI through encryption, audit controls, and
  patient engagement capabilities. Security violations can result in loss of Medicare/
  Medicaid incentive payments and attestation failures. Monitor EHR security
  posture and meaningful use objective compliance.
