#//RULE-HIPAA-02 — Terminated Employee Access to ePHI Not Revoked - §164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C)
#//Requirement: HIPAA Security Rule §164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C) - Termination Procedures
#//Objective: Detect ePHI access by terminated healthcare workers
#//Data sources: HR termination logs, authentication logs, access logs
#//ECS fields used: event.category, user.name, event.outcome, @timestamp
#//Tuning notes: Integrate with HR system; maintain terminated employee list

name: "RULE-HIPAA-02: Terminated Healthcare Worker Accessing ePHI"
description: |
  Identifies authentication or access to ePHI systems by terminated healthcare
  employees, contractors, or volunteers. HIPAA §164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C) requires
  termination procedures including immediate access removal. Detects successful
  logins, database queries, or EHR access by users on terminated employee list
  post-termination date. Common in healthcare due to complex access provisioning
  across multiple clinical systems. Critical compliance gap requiring immediate
  access revocation and incident investigation.
