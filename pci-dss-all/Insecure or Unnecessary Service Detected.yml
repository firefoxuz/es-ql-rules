#//RULE-PCI-05 — Insecure Service Enabled (PCI 2.2.2)
#//Requirement: 2
#//Objective: Detect unnecessary or insecure services running
#//Data sources: Linux auditd, Windows services logs
#//ECS fields used: event.action, process.name, event.provider, event.original
#//Field validation: Verify these fields exist in your indices before enabling
#//Tuning notes: Define baseline of required services per system role; review quarterly

name: "Insecure or Unnecessary Service Detected"
description: |
  Identifies insecure protocols and services that should be disabled per PCI DSS 2.2.2
  (Telnet, FTP, HTTP on sensitive systems, SNMP v1/v2, etc.). Running unnecessary
  services increases attack surface and may violate system hardening standards.
  Tune by defining allowed services per system type and excluding authorized legacy
  systems with documented risk acceptance.
