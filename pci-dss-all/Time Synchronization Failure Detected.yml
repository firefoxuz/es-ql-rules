#//RULE-PCI-33 — System Time Synchronization Failure (PCI 10.4)
#//Requirement: 10
#//Objective: Detect NTP/time synchronization failures affecting audit trails
#//Data sources: NTP logs, system logs
#//ECS fields used: event.category, event.action, event.original
#//Field validation: Verify these fields exist in your indices before enabling
#//Tuning notes: Monitor NTP sync failures; alert on clock drift >threshold

name: "Time Synchronization Failure Detected"
description: |
  Identifies failures in time synchronization services (NTP, Windows Time) that
  could impact audit log accuracy and forensic investigation. PCI DSS 10.4 requires
  correct and consistent time across all critical systems using industry-accepted
  time sources. Time drift prevents accurate correlation of security events across
  systems. Monitor for NTP sync failures, large clock adjustments, and service errors.
