#//EVIDENCE-PCI-07 — Access Control Policies & Systems (PCI 7.1.4, 7.2, 7.3)
#//Requirement: 7
#//Objective: Documentation of access needs, approval processes, and deny-all policies
#//Why not detectable: Requires review of access control matrices defining role-based
#//permissions, approval workflows for access requests, default-deny ACL configurations,
#//and documented security policies. ES|QL cannot validate policy documentation or
#//system configuration baselines. Verified through policy review, access control
#//system audit, and approval ticket sampling.
#//RULE-PCI-22 — Password Brute Force Attack (PCI 8.1.6)
#//Requirement: 8
#//Objective: Detect repeated failed login attempts indicating brute force
#//Data sources: Windows Event Logs, Linux auditd, application logs
#//ECS fields used: event.category, event.outcome, user.name, source.ip
#//Tuning notes: Threshold 6 failures per 30min window; monitor account lockout events

name: "RULE-PCI-22: Password Brute Force Attack Detected"
description: |
  Identifies multiple failed authentication attempts from single source indicating
  password brute force or credential stuffing attack. PCI DSS 8.1.6 requires lockout
  after not more than 6 failed attempts. Exceeding threshold suggests automated
  attack or compromised credentials. Correlate with account lockout events and
  monitor for successful login after failures (credential validation).
