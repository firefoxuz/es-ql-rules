#//RULE-NIST-21 — Unencrypted Network Traffic (NIST SC-8, SC-13)
#//Control Family: SC (System and Communications Protection)
#//Objective: Detect sensitive data transmitted without encryption
#//Threat scenario: Credentials or PII transmitted in plaintext susceptible to interception
#//Data sources: Network traffic metadata, protocol analysis from packetbeat/filebeat
#//ECS fields used: network.protocol, destination.port, network.transport
#//Tuning notes: Allowlist known legacy systems, adjust for environment-specific protocols
#
name: "RULE-NIST-21: Plaintext Protocol Usage Detection"
description: |
  Detects usage of unencrypted protocols (HTTP, FTP, Telnet) when encrypted alternatives exist.
  Transmission on ports 80, 21, 23 without TLS wrapper exposes data to man-in-the-middle attacks.
  Focus on authentication traffic (login forms, API keys) or sensitive applications.
  False positives: Internal monitoring systems, legacy applications, development environments.
  Triage: Identify transmitted data sensitivity, verify if communication is internal only,
  plan migration to encrypted alternatives (HTTPS, SFTP, SSH).
