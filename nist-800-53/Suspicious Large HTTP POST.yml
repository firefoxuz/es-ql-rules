#//RULE-NIST-29 — Large POST Request Detection (NIST SC-5, SI-4)
#//Control Family: SC (System and Communications Protection), SI (System and Information Integrity)
#//Objective: Detect abnormally large POST requests indicating upload attacks or DoS
#//Threat scenario: Attacker uploads malicious files or attempts resource exhaustion
#//Data sources: Nginx access logs with request body size
#//ECS fields used: event.action, event.original.bytes, event.original, source.ip
#//Field validation: Verify all ECS fields exist in your indices before enabling
#//Tuning notes: Adjust size threshold per application (consider file upload endpoints)

name: "Suspicious Large HTTP POST"
description: |
  Detects POST requests with unusually large body sizes that may indicate file upload attacks or DoS.
  Bodies >10MB to non-upload endpoints suggest malicious file uploads (webshells, malware).
  Multiple large POSTs from single source may indicate resource exhaustion attack.
  False positives: Legitimate file uploads, media uploads, backup operations.
  Triage: Review target URL (is it upload endpoint?), check uploaded content type,
  verify if size within application limits, investigate for webshell deployment.
