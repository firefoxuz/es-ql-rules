#//RULE-NIST-04 — Remote Desktop Brute Force (NIST AC-17)
#//Control Family: AC (Access Control)
#//Objective: Detect RDP/SSH brute force attacks on remote access services
#//Threat scenario: Attacker attempts to gain initial access via exposed remote services
#//Data sources: Windows Security 4625 (FailureReason 0xC000006D), Linux auth.log SSH failures
#//ECS fields used: event.code, network.protocol, source.ip, destination.port, user.name
#//Tuning notes: Adjust threshold for VPN vs direct RDP, allowlist known jump hosts

name: "RULE-NIST-04: Remote Access Brute Force Detection"
description: |
  Detects brute force attacks against RDP (port 3389) and SSH (port 22) services.
  Multiple failed authentication attempts from single source indicate automated credential stuffing.
  High risk when targeting internet-facing systems or critical infrastructure.
  False positives: User with forgotten password, legacy applications with hardcoded credentials.
  Triage: Check source IP reputation, review geo-location anomalies, verify if target account is privileged.
