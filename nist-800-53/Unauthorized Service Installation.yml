#//RULE-NIST-13 — Baseline Configuration Drift (NIST CM-2)
#//Control Family: CM (Configuration Management)
#//Objective: Detect deviations from approved baseline configurations
#//Threat scenario: Unauthorized software installation or service enablement
#//Data sources: Windows services started, Linux systemd service changes
#//ECS fields used: event.action, event.provider, process.name
#//Field validation: Verify all ECS fields exist in your indices before enabling
#//Tuning notes: Requires approved service baseline, adjust for environment-specific services
#
name: "Unauthorized Service Installation"
description: |
  Detects installation or starting of new Windows services or Linux systemd units not in approved baseline.
  New services often indicate malware persistence, RAT deployment, or unauthorized software.
  Focus on services starting from unusual paths or with suspicious names.
  False positives: Legitimate software installations, Windows updates, driver installations.
  Triage: Check service executable signature, verify service path legitimacy, 
  review if installation authorized via change management.
