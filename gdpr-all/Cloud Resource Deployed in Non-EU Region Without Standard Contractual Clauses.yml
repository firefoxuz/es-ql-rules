#//RULE-GDPR-36 — Personal Data in Non-EU Cloud Region Without SCCs (GDPR Article 46)
#//Requirement: Article 46
#//Objective: Detect cloud deployments outside EU without transfer safeguards
#//Data sources: Cloud provider API logs, infrastructure deployment logs
#//ECS fields used: cloud.region, event.action, log.original
#//Tuning notes: Monitor cloud resource creation; verify SCC/BCR coverage

name: "RULE-GDPR-36: Cloud Resource Deployed in Non-EU Region Without Standard Contractual Clauses"
description: |
  Identifies cloud infrastructure resources (VMs, databases, storage buckets)
  deployed in non-EU/EEA regions without documented Standard Contractual Clauses
  (SCCs), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), or other Article 46 safeguards. Detects
  AWS/Azure/GCP resource creation in US, Asia-Pacific, or other third-country
  regions processing EU personal data. Post-Schrems II, cloud deployments require
  transfer mechanisms and supplementary measures assessment. Monitor IaC deployments
  and cloud API calls for region parameters.
