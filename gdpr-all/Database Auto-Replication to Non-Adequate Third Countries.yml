#//RULE-GDPR-37 — Multi-Region Data Replication Without Geo-Fencing (GDPR Chapter V)
#//Requirement: Articles 44-46
#//Objective: Detect automatic data replication to non-adequate countries
#//Data sources: Database replication logs, cloud sync logs
#//ECS fields used: event.original, event.action, event.original
#//GDPR field validation: Verify personal data fields exist (user.email, geo.country, etc.)
#//Tuning notes: Monitor database replication; enforce geo-restrictions
#//NOTE: Requires cloud provider integration (AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, GCP Audit Log)

name: "Database Auto-Replication to Non-Adequate Third Countries"
description: |
  Identifies automatic database replication, backup, or synchronization to geographic
  regions outside EU/EEA or countries without adequacy decisions, violating GDPR
  transfer restrictions. Detects multi-region database clusters with replicas in
  US/Asia, cloud backup policies storing in non-EU regions, or CDN configurations
  caching personal data globally. Automatic replication may bypass transfer safeguards
  and create shadow copies in jurisdictions with inadequate protections. Verify
  geo-fencing policies and data residency controls.
